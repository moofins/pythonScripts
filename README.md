# pythonScripts

Pentesting frequently requires quick ad hoc scripting, and Python is a great language to use when it's needed. While I haven't worked on large-scale Python projects, it is one my most frequently used language for putting together fast dirty code to get the job done in the middle of testing. I keep a directory of old python code to refer back to when I need, and this is an upload of the directory to back it up.
